# Synappcss
Scientimagically compile jade/sass(bourbon/neat) &amp; optimise images with the help of gulp. Pleeease flavored.

FUNCTIONS :
- **gulp clean:prod** = clean the prod folder (sometimes you will need this, trust me)
- **gulp clean:dev** = just joking, are u a masochist?
- **gulp zip:prod** = zip the prod folder
- **gulp zip:dev** = zip the dev folder
- **gulp** = default task (sass, bourbon, neat, pleeease, jade, js, coffee, imgmin...)
- **gulp img** = optimise pictures
- **gulp watch** = same as gulp + browser-sync
- I recommend using gulp watch in dev, and when launch using gulp clean:prod, gulp, gulp zip:prod

## To do :
- Using Dploy if possible
- gulp-notify if this is really necessary (not sure about that)
- Understand better how npm packages are updated
- MVC model with jade/sass (already working on that)
- Making a doc for that, and aliases for mixins, in english & french
- bat file to open Cmder & launch **gulp watch** immediatly
- add special regognition of the framework for apps like wappalyzer (meta generator/special class... who know)
- basic coffeescript for adding classes on click (for example)
- making use of bower/yeoman (?)
- Top bonus : wordpress version (maybe with the underscore theme)
- better integration of https://github.com/JonathanWolfe/file-tree-exclude (for excluding some folders in brackets if u use it)
- reformat & optimise the gulpfile.js (please help for that)
- for example : merge the vanilla js with the compiler coffeescript without crashing everything

Thats all !
